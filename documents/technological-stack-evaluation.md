# Technological Stack Evaluation

## Technical Stacks under consideration

- [Native Scripts](https://www.nativescript.org/)
  - Native scripts uses Javascript to build native apps. It comes along with Angular and Vue.js. The community for Angular is not as active as Vue.js.
  - It works with it's own pre-defined components rather than HTML
  - Restyling of components is very difficult, component set is limited too.
  - Components do not exists on both platforms, need to be maintenance for those.
- [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Flutter.io](https://flutter.io/) and [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/)
  - SDK and framework for DART
  - Compilles down to native code that runs on target device, no additional tool chain is required.
  - In-built functionalities:
    - IDE Extenstions
    - Development Server
    - Live updating of app on emulator and real device
  - Restyling of components is bit easier than native scripts
  - Widgets can easily be modified on the basis of platform easily
  - Pretty new, less community support but backed up Google (plugins are available for camera, WiFi, Commectivity and bluetooth)

## Points under consideration from evaluations

- Write once, use everywhere (code re-usage)

- Rich Pre-style components

- Ecosystem/Third Parties Libraries

- Popularity

- Accessing Native Device Feature

- Real world usage

## Suggestion

- Based on the above evaluation and also looking bit around _flutter.io_ seems to be winnig the race in comparison of features available and performance.
- Flutter only lags in the community support or some third party libraries.
